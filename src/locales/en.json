        "title": "How does product certification work?",
        "text": "<p>Product certification is the process of confirming that a product complies with established safety, quality and technical regulations. It starts with submitting an application to an accredited body. The applicant provides a set of documents: technical specifications (if available), instructions, product description, contract, labels and more. The certification body then sends product samples to an accredited laboratory for testing. Based on test reports, a conformity decision is made. In some cases, an additional production inspection is conducted. After all stages, a certificate of conformity is issued, registered in the state register and provided to the applicant. Without such a document, products cannot be legally sold in Russia or the EAEU countries if they are included in the mandatory certification list.</p>"
      },
      {
        "title": "Where to start importing goods?",
        "text": "<p>Import starts with legal and logistics preparation. The first step is to determine the TN VED code of the product. It defines whether certification, registration, sanitary documents, permits or other controls are required. Next, a contract with the foreign supplier is prepared, along with an invoice and packing list. If required, certification documents are submitted so that permits are available by the time of import. Then shipment is arranged and the goods pass customs clearance at the border. The declarant provides all necessary documents, including certificates or declarations of conformity. Without them, goods may not be released into circulation. The importer must consider risks: incorrect codes, document errors or border delays can lead to fines and downtime. It is recommended to consult logistics and certification specialists at the preparation stage.</p>"
      },
      {
        "title": "Where to start launching production?",
        "text": "<p>Launching production is a complex process with several key stages. First is registering a legal entity and tax registration. Next is choosing an appropriate OKVED code and preparing technical documentation: TU (technical specifications), formulations, drawings and process charts. At this stage, it is also important to determine whether the product is subject to mandatory certification, declaration, registration or licensing. After that come selecting/setting up a production facility, purchasing equipment, hiring staff and tuning the production process. Even small batches must meet safety requirements; otherwise they cannot be legally sold. You should also consider logistics, packaging, labeling and legal risks. It is advisable to set up quality control before entering the market to avoid claims and fines.</p>"
      },
      {
        "title": "Which goods require a GOST R certificate?",
        "text": "<p>A GOST R certificate is required for products included in the mandatory certification list approved by the Government of the Russian Federation. It includes various product groups that may pose risks: electrical goods, household appliances, construction materials, cables, furniture, children’s goods, PPE, certain types of clothing, footwear and toys. The key criterion is potential risk to health and safety. If a product is not in the list, you can obtain a refusal letter or pass voluntary certification. Since the 2010s, most products have moved under Customs Union technical regulations, and GOST R remains only for goods not covered by CU TR. Always check the current list and consult specialists — mistakes may lead to fines and customs arrest.</p>"
      },
      {
        "title": "What is the difference between a CU TR certificate and a CU TR declaration?",
        "text": "<p>Both a certificate and a declaration of conformity to CU TR confirm that products meet the requirements of the Customs Union technical regulations. The main difference is the procedure and the level of responsibility. A certificate is issued through an accredited body: testing is performed by a third-party laboratory, everything is verified externally, and responsibility is shared between the body and the applicant. A declaration is registered by the applicant: they may use their own or third-party test reports, but the applicant bears full legal responsibility for the data. The form depends on the regulation list. In some cases both are allowed, and businesses often choose a declaration as it is cheaper and faster. However, liability for violations is higher for declarations, including administrative and criminal consequences.</p>"
      },
      {
        "title": "What are the fines for an incorrect EAEU declaration?",
        "text": "<p>Providing a false or invalid EAEU declaration is a serious offense. If it turns out that the product does not comply with the declared requirements, a company can be fined up to 1 million rubles under Article 14.43 of the Code of Administrative Offenses. Confiscation of goods, withdrawal of the declaration from the register, a ban on sales in the EAEU, and removal from marketplaces are also possible. Repeated violations may result in temporary suspension of activities. If consequences affected health or property, sanctions are stricter up to criminal liability. The applicant must store evidence (test reports, labeling samples, etc.) for 10 years. Any discrepancy between the declaration and reality (e.g., different manufacturer, composition or country) is a reason for inspection and fines.</p>"
      },
      {
        "title": "Is certification required for custom-made goods?",
        "text": "<p>Yes. A custom order does not exempt you from legal requirements if the product falls under mandatory certification or declaration. For example, custom clothing, made-to-order furniture or custom equipment still require documents if they are sold, supplied or exported. The only exception is goods used strictly for personal needs and not placed into circulation. This is especially relevant for marketplaces: without a declaration/certificate a product listing can be blocked. In some cases, TU may be required if there is no applicable GOST. Custom-made goods are subject to the same safety, labeling and packaging requirements as mass production — it is important to consider this from the start to avoid issues later.</p>"
      },
      {
        "title": "What to do with inventory after a certificate expires?",
        "text": "<p>If you have inventory in stock and the certificate/declaration has expired, it depends on the import/production date. By law, you may sell remaining stock if it was received before the document expired, provided you have supporting documents (invoices, acceptance acts, internal records). Such stock is considered legal. But if the product was received after expiration, selling it is a violation. In that case, fines, returns and suspension of activities are possible. The optimal solution is to re-issue a new certificate for the batch or register a separate declaration for the remaining stock. You can also temporarily pause sales and, if needed, repackage with updated labeling. This is especially important for marketplaces and offline retail under inspections.</p>"
      },
      {
        "title": "Can one declaration cover multiple manufacturers?",
        "text": "<p>No, not under standard rules. A declaration of conformity is registered for a specific manufacturer with its exact name, address and country. Even if products are identical, but made by different manufacturers, each requires its own set of documents. This is because each manufacturer bears individual responsibility for safety. An exception may be possible if manufacturers are within one group, use the same formulation and production lines and this is documented. In typical practice: one declaration = one manufacturer. Violations may lead to document annulment, fines and blocking at customs or online platforms.</p>"
      },
      {
        "title": "Do I need to re-issue a certificate if the address changes?",
        "text": "<p>Yes. Changing the legal address or the actual location of the manufacturer requires re-issuing a certificate or declaration. By law, conformity documents must contain accurate information about the applicant and manufacturer. If the address changes (e.g., a new workshop, relocation to another region/country), the document becomes invalid. This applies to both Russian and foreign manufacturers. If a mismatch is found during an inspection, the products may be considered illegal. To avoid sanctions, you must either apply for amendments (if allowed) or register a new document. Labeling, packaging and accompanying documents must also be updated.</p>"
      },
      {
        "title": "Can I list multiple goods in one refusal letter?",
        "text": "<p>Yes, but only under certain conditions. One refusal letter can include multiple goods if they belong to one product group, fall under the same classifier section and are not subject to mandatory certification or declaration. All TN VED codes must be correct, with product descriptions and a reference to the regulation confirming that certification is not required. Such a document is often requested for customs clearance or marketplaces. However, if goods differ significantly by purpose/composition or belong to different groups, it is recommended to issue separate refusal letters to avoid misunderstandings and additional requests. The more precise the wording, the lower the risks.</p>"
